## Overview

The CCHA power analysis evaluates the effect of reducing sampling effort for vegetation transects at all long-term monitoring sites in Tampa Bay.  Currently, sampling is conducted every half meter and the power analysis evaluates the effect of reduced effort up to sampling every ten meters, or a 95% reduction from the current effort.  Scenarios evaluating more than 50% (1 meter sampling) or 66% (1.5 meter sampling) reduction in effort are unrealistic, but still useful to understand the effects on quantitative measures of habitat.  These measures include:

1. Total species richness at a site
1. Total species richness at a site by vegetation zone
1. Species frequency occurrence at a site
1. Species frequency occurrence at a site by vegetation zone
1. Vegetation zone distances by site
1. Elevation range at which 95% of key species occur (e.g., mangroves) 

The relative reduction in effort associated with each half-meter increase along a transect is shown below.

## Sub-sampling scheme

All existing CCHA vegetation surveys were sub-sampled from the existing effort of sample plots every half meter.  The plot below shows an example of the sub-sampling scheme, where effort was reduced in increments of a half meter, starting from the complete survey to an upper limit of sampling every ten meters.  For simplicity, the plot shows sub-sampling up to every three meters for a hypothetical 30 meter transect (transect exceed 100 meters at all site).  

The existing surveys were sub-sampled at the specified meter interval for every unique subset (or replicate) that was possible.  For example, two unique replicates can be created with sub-sampling every one meter, three every 1.5 meters, etc.  

The large red points show which of the existing survey points were sub-sampled for the specified sub-sample distance.  For each site and sample year, the vegetation transect was sub-sampled following the scheme below (sub-sampling up to ten meters) and relevant habitat summaries were estimated.  The top row represents the complete transect, or the "truth". 

```{r}
column(12, 
  column(3, 
    download_file(
      path = here('figs/subsampex.jpg'),
      output_name = "subsample-ex",
      output_extension = ".jpg",
      button_label = "Download plot",
      button_type = "warning",
      has_icon = TRUE,
      icon = "fa fa-save"
      )
  )
)
